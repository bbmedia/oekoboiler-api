# oekoboiler-api

oekoboiler-api is a Python library to read out properties like current temperature from your Oekoboiler water heater.

Use at your own risk! You can damage your boiler by setting wrong parameters!

Home Assistant integration based on this library is coming soon.

## Disclaimer

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install oekoboiler-api.

```bash
pip install oekoboiler-api
```

## Usage (see src/example/main.py)

1. Update .example_env with your data and rename it to .env
2. Run src/example/main.py to see if the connection to your Oekoboiler works. The current water temperature should be printed to console.

```cfg
#Insert your credentials and rename this file to ".env" (remove "example_env"). 
#Now you can execute main.py to run the example.

#The email used to create an account in your Oekoboiler app
AYLA_EMAIL=your_oekoboiler_account@mail.com

#The password used to create an account in your Oekoboiler app
AYLA_PW=oekoboiler_app_pw

#The app secret for Oekoboiler. If your not able to find it somewhere, ask Oekoboiler!
AYLA_APP_SECRET=ayla_secret_for_oekoboiler

#The device id for your Oekoboiler (Revealed in Oekobiler App). 
OEKOBOILER_SN=YOUR_DEVICE_ID 
```

    boiler = Oekoboiler(
        AylaService(
            Credentials(
                email=os.getenv("AYLA_EMAIL"),
                password=os.getenv("AYLA_PW"),

        ),
        os.getenv("OEKOBOILER_SN"),
    )

    await boiler.async_update()
    print(f"Current temperature is {boiler.temp_c_current}CÂ°")
